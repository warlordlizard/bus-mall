Monday:
  today was an interesting day.  I accidentally called an id in javascript without declaring it.  It was working even though it should not have been.  I forgot to add the document before getElementById.  For the build today it was easy html and css, javascript was harder.  I managed to create my objects using a constructor, get my pictures to render at random, and used if statements to ensure they did not repeat.  I could not figure out haw to register clicks onto the object the picture represented.

  I feel a bit closer to solving click issue.  maybe making a handler is the solution.  I displayed a pie chart on my page and used a for loop to make a labels array that i could use inside the chart.  this is likely how I would add the data as well (once i have it), in the meantime I created an array called productData filled with fake data so I could display something.

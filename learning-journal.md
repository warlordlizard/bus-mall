Monday:
  today was an interesting day.  I accidentally called an id in javascript without declaring it.  It was working even though it should not have been.  I forgot to add the document before getElementById.  For the build today it was easy html and css, javascript was harder.  I managed to create my objects using a constructor, get my pictures to render at random, and used if statements to ensure they did not repeat.  I could not figure out haw to register clicks onto the object the picture represented.

Tuesday:
  I feel a bit closer to solving click issue.  maybe making a handler is the solution.  I displayed a pie chart on my page and used a for loop to make a labels array that i could use inside the chart.  this is likely how I would add the data as well (once i have it), in the meantime I created an array called productData filled with fake data so I could display something.
  -update: almost there.  can't get timesClicked to push to productData.  I tried using for loop and even imputing by hand using Product.allProducts[i].totalClicks where i is 1-20. putting back fake data for now.

Wednesday:
  got productData working( put inside handler at micheal's advice).  Now data is populating to chart.  added localStorage persistance to totalClicks and totalCounter.  now when you exit page you can come back and finish or if you are finished the images don't appear the button is already there for chart.  super happy with progress.  

Thursday:
  First day of working on group project.  I feel it went well.  My app idea was picked (text based adventure).  Once our group got together we started brainstorming ideas for a theme and layout.  we settled on star wars as the theme.  the app will have a static header and footer, the background for the body is atm decided on stars, and the text scenarios will be in a box in the center of the page.  we did basic HTML scaffolding, basic css layout, and some JS ideas.
